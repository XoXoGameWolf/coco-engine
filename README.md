<h1>Coco Engine</h1>

<p>Coco Engine is a C-based engine written by XoXoGameWolf. It has support for OpenGL, OpenAL, Windows cross-compiling, .obj loading, and more.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Coco Engine requires a few compiling tools, those being Make for compiling, gcc for compiling the Linux build, and mingw32-gcc for compiling the Windows build. It has to be built on Linux or WSL.</p>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>After modifying the code in "src", you can run "make" in the base directory to compile. You can run "make linux" and "make windows" for the specific targets. After compiling, run "build/app" or "build/app.exe" from the home directory, or use the .zip files. The name for the distributions are configurable at the top of the Makefile.</p>
